								<h2>Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (UCF Chapter)</h2>

								<p>
									SEDS was the first club I joined at UCF while I was still fully virtual during COVID. 
									The transition from high school to college was hard, and I still wanted to find a path into the space industry. 
									I kept reaching out to people through the SEDS Discord and on LinkedIn. 
									Those messages led to projects, mentorship, and my first real community on campus.
								</p>

								<h3>Projects</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Rover chassis:</strong> designed the frame in SolidWorks, created drawings for the shop, and improved maneuverability and serviceability.</li>
									<li><strong>Liquid bi-propellant team:</strong> built a propulsion FMEA and test procedures that raised safety and test readiness.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Leadership</h3>
								<p>
									I served one year as Secretary. I organized agendas and notes, tracked actions, and helped run workshops on machining, electronics, and safety.
								</p>

								<h3>Community and opportunity</h3>
								<p>
									SEDS introduced me to my closest friend group. Through the SEDS@UCF Discord I found the opening at Exolith Lab that became my internship and later my part-time job. 
									The same outreach helped me join space projects and hypersonic materials research during my freshman year.
								</p>

								<p><em>I owe a lot to this club.</em></p>

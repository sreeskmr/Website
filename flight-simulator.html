								<h2>Senior Design Project</h2>
								<h3>Mechanical Design</h3>
									<p>
									The F-35 Throttle Controller was engineered to replicate the <strong>ergonomics, detents, and resistance
									characteristics</strong> of the actual aircraft throttle while remaining affordable and modular. The throttle
									had to mount securely to Talon Simulations’ 2-DoF motion platform and align with in-game cockpit geometry
									for a seamless VR experience. Benchmarking against commercial products from Wraith Systems, RealSimulator,
									and Bugeye revealed a gap: existing throttles were either prohibitively expensive or lacked authentic feel.
									Our design sought to bridge this gap by combining realistic tactile response with manufacturability under a
									$1,000 budget.
									</p>

									<p>
									From a requirements standpoint, the throttle needed to reproduce <em>idle, military power, and afterburner
									detents</em> with both tactile and mechanical fidelity. Target resistance was set between 1–3 pounds for
									normal use, with peaks up to 5 pounds under high-performance flight conditions. To meet these targets, the
									design incorporated a <strong>magnet-based detent system and a DryLin linear rail mechanism</strong> that
									provided smooth travel with distinct stops at critical throttle positions. Materials included reinforced
									thermoplastics via 3D printing for housings, and machined aluminum for high-stress components.
									</p>

									</figure>
									<br>
									<p>
									A <strong>belt and pulley system</strong> was modeled within the CAD environment to simulate the throttle’s
									motion transfer mechanism. This subsystem converts the physical motion of the throttle lever into a trackable
									signal that can be interpreted by the flight simulator software. Linear motion analyses were performed to
									evaluate tension, deflection, and backlash within the belt system, ensuring consistent performance and accurate
									positional feedback across the entire throttle range. The CAD model served not only as a visualization tool but
									also as a functional design validation platform, allowing the team to troubleshoot mechanical interactions
									before prototyping began.
									</p>
									
									<p>
									To further enhance fidelity, the team modeled the <strong>Taiss optical rotary encoder</strong> that provides
									high-resolution throttle position feedback. The model reflected shaft diameter, mounting points, and electrical
									interfaces to ensure proper integration. Including the encoder in the assembly allowed for verification of spatial
									compatibility and the design of custom mounts and couplings. This enabled precise alignment with the throttle’s
									moving components and streamlined system integration planning.
									</p>

									<p>
									The <strong>Igus DryLin® T HKA carriage</strong> played a critical role in providing precise linear motion control
									and customizable resistance during operation. The carriage’s adjustable side knob allowed fine-tuning of bearing
									preload against the rail, introducing variable frictional resistance along the axis. This feature simulated
									different throttle tension profiles, such as the increased resistance when pushing into afterburner zones, without
									requiring additional springs or dampers. Rear-positioned Allen screws locked the carriage structurally, eliminating
									undesired lateral or vertical play. This constrained the system to pure x-axis motion, preventing wobble or tilt and
									ensuring clean, repeatable travel for consistent sensor readings.
									</p>

									<p>
									To accurately reproduce the F-35 throttle grip, known as the <em>cowpie</em>, the team conducted a
									<strong>3D scan at the Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation (AFAMS)</strong>. Using a CrealityScan
									3D scanner, we captured the geometry of a reference throttle directly from an operational simulator.
									This scan provided the baseline dimensions and contours of the grip, which are not publicly available.
									</p>

									<p>
									The raw scan data presented challenges: many surfaces were patchy or uneven, and holes existed where
									buttons and switches had been scanned. To address this, the mesh was imported into <strong>Blender Studio</strong>
									where the geometry was smoothed, gaps were filled, and button holes were reconstructed. The repaired mesh was
									then transferred into <strong>SolidWorks</strong>, where precise cutouts were modeled for each switch, hat, and
									rotary input. This hybrid workflow of scanning, mesh editing, and CAD refinement allowed the team to create a
									dimensionally accurate and manufacturable throttle grip.

									Once refined, the model was <strong>3D printed</strong> using PLA for rapid prototyping. This allowed the
									team to iteratively test button placement, ergonomics, and internal clearances. The iterative prototyping
									process ensured that by the time the actual switches arrived, the grip geometry was already optimized for
									both fit and function. By leveraging 3D scanning and digital mesh refinement, the team shortened the
									development cycle while maintaining fidelity to the F-35’s true control geometry.

									Overall, the mechanical design provided both a <strong>digital validation tool and a manufacturing roadmap</strong>.
									By combining linear rails, belt-driven motion transfer, rotary encoders, and ergonomically modeled grips, the design
									laid a robust foundation for physical prototyping. This approach ensured that once built, the throttle would deliver
									smooth travel across its 9-inch range, crisp magnetic detents, and reliable positional accuracy.
									</p>

								<h3>Electronics Integration</h3>
									<p>
									The throttle’s electronics were built around a <strong>Raspberry Pi 5</strong> acting as the central controller.
									Because the Pi has no native analog inputs, we added an <strong>MCP3008 10-bit ADC</strong> on SPI to read analog
									devices (e.g., multi-axis hats and potentiometers), while the Pi’s GPIO handled the <strong>digital switches,
									toggles, and the Taiss optical rotary encoder</strong> used for primary throttle position. In total, the system
									supported <strong>~29 inputs</strong> across the grip and base.
									</p>

									<figure>

									<br>
									<p>
									The wiring harness routed inputs to a small breakout/terminal board and then to the Pi. <strong>Digital lines</strong>
									used pull-ups/pull-downs and software debouncing to tame switch chatter, while <strong>analog lines</strong>
									fed the MCP3008’s CH0–CH7 channels via short runs and protective <em>voltage dividers</em> where necessary to keep
									everything within 3.3&nbsp;V logic limits. The encoder produced clean quadrature pulses read by the Pi with edge
									interrupts. A simple health-check layer in software flagged lines that were floating or saturated, speeding up
									troubleshooting during bring-up.
									</p>

									</figure>
									<br>
									<p>
									On the software side, a Python service on the Pi sampled the MCP3008, polled/latched GPIO states, applied
									<strong>debounce and dead-zone filters</strong>, and packed everything into a compact message sent over
									<strong>UDP</strong> to a PC client. There, inputs were mapped to the simulator using <em>vJoy</em> and
									<em>SimConnect</em> so the throttle appeared as a native controller in <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> and
									<em>DCS World</em>.
									</p>

									<p>
									The build also came with real-world hurdles. Some critical components arrived late, so we <strong>repurposed
									buttons from older controllers</strong> that lacked documentation. That forced careful bench testing to determine
									pinouts, signal types, and required conditioning. Wiring took longer than planned because we worked methodically to
									<strong>avoid shorts and over-voltage conditions</strong>—measuring each rail with a multimeter, confirming grounds,
									and validating that any 5&nbsp;V devices were safely level-shifted or isolated from the Pi’s 3.3&nbsp;V logic.
									</p>

									<p>
									A major issue came from the <strong>Taiss optical rotary encoder</strong>. Although rated for 5–24&nbsp;V operation,
									we discovered during testing that its internal regulator required at least ~7&nbsp;V to output stable and accurate
									signals. At 5&nbsp;V, the readings were noisy and inconsistent. The solution was to <strong>power the encoder from a
									dedicated higher-voltage supply</strong> instead of the Pi’s 5&nbsp;V rail, while keeping the signal lines properly
									level-shifted for compatibility. This ensured accurate position tracking without risking the Pi’s GPIO.
									</p>

									<p>
									Despite the administrative delays and scavenged parts, the final integration was stable and repeatable, with clean
									encoder counts and reliable button states across the full throttle range. The architecture delivered a
									<strong>responsive, low-latency pipeline</strong> from physical inputs to simulator actions, while remaining
									maintainable: analog expansion is as simple as assigning another MCP3008 channel, and additional digital inputs can
									be added through spare GPIO and I²C/SPI expanders if needed.
									</p>

								<h3>Software Development</h3>
									<p>
									The software architecture for the throttle system was designed to <strong>bridge low-level hardware inputs with
									high-level simulator commands</strong>. On the <strong>Raspberry Pi 5</strong>, a Python service continuously
									polled GPIO states, read analog channels from the MCP3008 over SPI, and counted quadrature pulses from the
									Taiss rotary encoder. Custom <strong>debounce and cooldown logic</strong> filtered mechanical switch noise, while
									<strong>analog dead-zones</strong> stabilized the output of multi-axis hats and joysticks. This ensured that user
									inputs were responsive without being jittery or over-sensitive.
									</p>

									<p>
									Processed inputs were encoded into a lightweight packet and transmitted to the PC via <strong>UDP sockets</strong>.
									This networking layer kept latency extremely low while allowing the Pi to operate headless. On the PC side, the
									throttle inputs were mapped through <em>vJoy</em> to appear as a <strong>virtual joystick</strong>, enabling direct
									compatibility with <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> and <em>DCS World</em>. For MSFS, additional integration was
									achieved through <em>SimConnect</em>, which allowed custom events and throttle positions to be read natively by the
									simulator.
									</p>

									<p>
									To simplify setup and testing, the team built a <strong>Python/Tkinter-based GUI</strong> that acted as the user’s
									front end. The GUI connected directly to the Pi without requiring repeated manual configuration—only the Pi’s IP
									address needed to be entered once for each new Wi-Fi network. After that, the GUI handled connections
									automatically, launching the Pi-side program to stream inputs to vJoy.
									The GUI supported <strong>live tracking</strong> of all throttle inputs, including button presses, toggle states,
									and throttle position. This allowed users to visually confirm that hardware signals were being correctly captured
									before entering the simulator. The GUI also featured a <strong>dedicated instructions tab</strong> with setup
									guidance, making the system approachable for new operators and providing troubleshooting steps for connectivity
									or mapping issues.
									</p>

									<br>
									<p>
									Several issues arose during development. <strong>Analog hats</strong> initially proved too sensitive, producing
									rapid toggling from small finger movements. This was corrected with expanded dead-zones and short cooldown timers.
									The <strong>rotary encoder</strong> introduced lag when polled directly via interrupts, which was solved by switching
									to a threaded listener using the <em>pigpio</em> library. Button mapping for 29 inputs also required careful
									organization, especially to align with <strong>official F-35 HOTAS documentation</strong> so that simulator functions
									matched real-world control locations.
									</p>

									<p>
									Through these refinements, the software achieved <strong>real-time responsiveness and robust input handling</strong>.
									Together with the electronics and mechanical systems, it completed the end-to-end throttle controller pipeline:
									from user action on the grip, to microsecond-level signal processing, to full integration within modern flight
									simulation platforms.
									</p>

								<h3>Testing & Validation</h3>
									<p>
									After completing the integration of mechanical, electrical, and software systems, the team conducted a comprehensive
									<strong>testing and validation campaign</strong> to ensure the throttle performed reliably under real-world conditions.
									The process began with <strong>bench testing</strong> of wiring and GPIO channels. Using a multimeter, each connection
									was verified for continuity and correct voltage levels to prevent shorts or over-voltage damage to the Raspberry Pi.
									Special care was taken with repurposed switches, which lacked documentation and required empirical testing to identify
									pinouts.
									</p>

									<p>
									Validation of the <strong>rotary encoder</strong> was a critical step. Early tests revealed unstable counts when powered
									from 5&nbsp;V, which was traced to an internal regulator that required ~7&nbsp;V minimum for proper operation. Once the
									encoder was powered from an external supply and signals were level-shifted for compatibility, it delivered consistent,
									high-resolution tracking across the full 9-inch throttle throw.
									</p>

									<p>
									On the mechanical side, the <strong>Igus rail carriage</strong> and linear motion system were tested for smoothness,
									alignment, and long-term wear. The carriage maintained precise x-axis motion without lateral play, ensuring reliable
									input readings. Detent mechanisms were exercised repeatedly to confirm crisp engagement at afterburner and idle zones,
									simulating the tactile feedback of a real throttle.
									</p>

									<p>
									The <strong>GUI validation</strong> phase confirmed that all 29 inputs could be live-tracked in real time without
									lag or false triggering. The interface also successfully launched the Pi-side program and maintained stable UDP
									communication, with the “No signal from Pi” status working as a diagnostic tool during simulated disconnects.
									</p>

									<p>
									Finally, the system underwent <strong>simulator integration testing</strong>. Inputs streamed from the Pi were mapped
									through vJoy and SimConnect into <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> and <em>DCS World</em>. Throttle movement,
									button presses, and toggle states were accurately reflected in the cockpit environment, validating the end-to-end
									control pipeline from hardware grip to virtual aircraft.
									</p>

									<p>
									While <strong>force feedback</strong> was not implemented in this version of the throttle, the mechanical detents and
									friction adjustments provided sufficient tactile realism for immersive flight simulation. The testing campaign verified
									that the throttle was both <strong>robust and responsive</strong>, laying the foundation for future iterations that
									could introduce haptic or force-feedback elements.
									</p>

								<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
									<p>
									While the throttle system successfully met its functional requirements, several areas for improvement were
									identified during development and testing. One of the most immediate challenges was <strong>part sourcing</strong>.
									Delays in component deliveries forced the team to repurpose buttons from older controllers, which created
									documentation gaps and extended wiring time. Future iterations would benefit from <strong>ready access to hardware</strong>,
									reducing project risk and build time.
									</p>

									<p>
									Another limitation was <strong>housing size</strong>. The throttle body was constrained by the available 3D printers,
									leading to a modular print-and-assemble process. With access to a larger printer, or a housing redesign optimized for
									available tools, the system could achieve a stronger and more seamless structure. Similarly, <strong>in-house 3D printing
									of buttons</strong> would reduce production expenses while giving the team full control over ergonomics and durability.
									</p>

									<p>
									Mechanically, improvements to the <strong>linear rail system</strong> could further enhance stability. A dual-rail
									configuration would reduce wobble and distribute forces evenly along the lever, improving long-term wear and input
									consistency. Additionally, the detent system could be made more <strong>customizable</strong> by replacing static
									magnetic detents with a <em>cam/roller spring system</em>, allowing pilots to adjust detent resistance profiles to match
									different flight scenarios.
									</p>

									<p>
									On the electrical side, the team identified an issue with <strong>wiring noise</strong>. During demonstrations,
									overlapping button wires caused <em>phantom activations</em>, where random button presses registered without user input.
									This will be addressed in future revisions by improving cable management, adding shielding where necessary, and spacing
									parallel wire runs to reduce interference. Together, these refinements would significantly improve system reliability
									and polish for long-term use.
